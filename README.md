# Foundry: Deploying And Forking Mainnet With Foundry 

## Introduction
In this tutorial, I will take you through how to deploy smart contract and fork the Celo Alfajores testnet with **Foundry**.
Some of us smart contract developers danced the bhangra when Foundry was released. But what is foundry?
**Foundry is a convenient and comprehensive suite of tools for building and deploying decentralized applications (DApps) on the blockchain**. It is convenient because it lets you write tests in Solidity instead of Javascript, which is the scripting and testing language of the Hardhat toolkit.

At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to fork mainnet or testnet for testing and deploy a smart contract using the foundry toolkit.
